# Specification Quality Checklist: Unit Testing Architecture Refactor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification:
- Clearly separates user value (fast tests, rapid feedback) from implementation
- Defines measurable success criteria (test execution times, coverage percentages)
- Provides comprehensive edge case coverage
- Establishes clear scope boundaries
- Identifies all dependencies (pytest plugins, existing test suite)
- Contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are well-defined based on industry-standard testing patterns

The specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.
