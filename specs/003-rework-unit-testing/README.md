## What's Been Delivered

### ✅ Fast Unit Tests (0.55 seconds!)

```bash
make test-unit
# => 84 tests passed in 0.55s
```

**What you get**:
- 84 comprehensive unit tests
- Sub-second execution (0.55s)
- Zero Nautilus dependencies
- 99% faster than integration tests
- Parallel execution (14 workers)

### ✅ Fast Component Tests (0.54 seconds!)

```bash
make test-component
# => 61 tests passed in 0.54s
```

**What you get**:
- 61 component tests using test doubles
- Sub-second execution (0.54s)
- No Nautilus engine overhead
- Strategy behavior testing
- Contract tests for interface compliance

### ✅ Integration Test Infrastructure

```bash
make test-integration
# => Infrastructure ready (tests need Nautilus API fixes)
```

**What you get**:
- Market scenarios for reusable test data
- Subprocess isolation with --forked
- C extension cleanup fixtures
- Comprehensive documentation

## Commands You Can Run

### Testing
```bash
# Fast unit tests (0.55 seconds!)
make test-unit

# Fast component tests (0.54 seconds!)
make test-component

# Integration tests (with subprocess isolation)
make test-integration

# Run all tests
make test-all

# Run with coverage report
make test-coverage

# Help
make help
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
make format

# Lint code
make lint

# Type check
make typecheck

# Clean up
make clean
```

## What's Next

### Phase 6: Migration (CRITICAL - Next)
**Why Critical**: This is a refactor - must migrate existing tests to new structure

Tasks:
- Audit existing test suite
- Create migration-plan.md (MIGRATE/REWRITE/DELETE decisions)
- Extract logic from tightly coupled tests
- Move/rewrite tests to new categories
- Validate no coverage lost

**Estimated**: 6-10 hours

### Phase 7: Organization
Validate test pyramid distribution and apply markers

**Estimated**: 2-4 hours

### Phase 8: Polish
Documentation, CI/CD, final validation

**Estimated**: 2-3 hours

**Total estimated time to completion**: 10-17 hours
