# Feature Specification: Nautilus Trader Backtesting System with IBKR Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-prd-md`  
**Created**: 2025-01-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "@docs/PRD.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a quantitative trader or developer, I want to backtest trading strategies on historical market data so that I can validate my trading logic and evaluate performance metrics before risking actual capital.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a trading strategy and access to Interactive Brokers market data, **When** they run a backtest on a single instrument for a specified date range, **Then** the system generates performance metrics and visualizations showing the strategy's historical performance.

2. **Given** a user has configured a simple moving average crossover strategy, **When** they execute it on AAPL stock from 2019-2024, **Then** they receive an HTML report with equity curve, trade history, and key metrics (Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate).

3. **Given** a user wants to test on multiple timeframes, **When** they configure their strategy to use 1-minute and daily bars simultaneously, **Then** the system correctly processes both data streams and executes trades based on the combined signals.

4. **Given** a user doesn't have access to IBKR data, **When** they provide historical data in CSV format, **Then** the system accepts the CSV data and runs the backtest with the same functionality.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when IBKR connection drops during data retrieval?
- How does system handle when requested historical data exceeds IBKR rate limits?
- What occurs if a strategy generates conflicting signals from different timeframes?
- How does the system respond when there's insufficient historical data for the requested period?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to connect to Interactive Brokers TWS/Gateway for data retrieval

- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate and display performance metrics including CAGR, Maximum Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Win Rate
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate visual reports showing equity curves and trade summaries
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multiple timeframes (1-minute, 5-minute, 1-hour, daily bars) within a single backtest
