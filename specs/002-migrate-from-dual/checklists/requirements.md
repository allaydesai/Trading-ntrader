# Specification Quality Checklist: Parquet-Only Market Data Storage

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass** - The specification avoids implementation details and focuses on user needs:
- Uses terms like "Parquet catalog" and "IBKR connection" without specifying Python libraries or frameworks
- Describes WHAT needs to happen (data fetching, storage, error handling) without HOW to implement
- Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - All requirements are complete and well-defined:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- All 39 functional requirements are written in testable form using MUST/SHALL language
- Success criteria are measurable and focus on functional outcomes (not performance metrics)
- Success criteria avoid technology-specific details (no mention of PyArrow, Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format for all 5 user stories
- Edge cases section covers 6 critical scenarios (corruption, partial fetches, concurrency, timezones, migration conflicts, disk space)
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (PostgreSQL metadata, cloud storage, DuckDB integration, performance optimizations)
- Assumptions section documents 9 key dependencies (IBKR access, disk space, migration approach)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Feature is ready for planning:
- Each of the 39 functional requirements maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- 5 user stories prioritized (P1, P1, P2, P2, P3) with independent test descriptions
- 10 success criteria provide measurable outcomes from user perspective
- No leakage of implementation concerns (all technical details are in testing/documentation sections, not requirements)

## Simplification Updates Applied

**User Feedback Incorporated** (2025-01-13):

1. ✅ **Removed Performance Requirements**:
   - Eliminated specific timing requirements (100ms read time, sub-second availability checks)
   - Removed storage footprint reduction targets (50%)
   - Removed compression specifications (Snappy)
   - Removed backtest initialization time comparisons

2. ✅ **Removed Backward Compatibility**:
   - Eliminated backward compatibility view requirement (old FR-031)
   - Removed CLI backward compatibility requirement (old FR-039)
   - Removed user experience outcome about backward compatibility (old UX-002)
   - Updated migration principle: "Existing features are migrated to the new Parquet approach or deprecated. No backward compatibility layers are maintained."

3. ✅ **Simplified Testing**:
   - Removed Performance Testing Benchmarks section entirely
   - Updated unit testing to focus on migration rather than compatibility
   - Updated integration testing to verify migrated features work correctly

4. ✅ **Updated Requirements Count**:
   - Reduced from 40 to 39 functional requirements (removed compression FR-005)
   - Renumbered requirements accordingly
   - Updated success criteria from 14 to 10 (removed 4 performance metrics)

5. ✅ **Clarified Migration Approach**:
   - Added explicit statement in assumptions: "Existing features and tests will be migrated to new Parquet approach or deprecated if not applicable"
   - Updated Phase 2 migration strategy to include feature/test migration
   - Simplified risk mitigation by removing feature flags and rollback complexity

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT (Simplified)

The specification demonstrates best practices with intentional simplification:
1. **Focused Scope**: Removed performance concerns to focus on functional correctness
2. **Clean Migration**: No backward compatibility complexity - clean break with clear migration path
3. **Prioritization**: User stories clearly prioritized with P1-P3 labels and independence justification
4. **Testability**: Every requirement is written in testable form with clear acceptance criteria
5. **Risk Management**: Simplified risk mitigation focuses on data preservation and testing
6. **Boundary Definition**: Clear out-of-scope section includes performance optimizations

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ YES

This specification is ready to proceed to either:
- `/speckit.clarify` - If stakeholder clarifications are needed (not required - spec is complete)
- `/speckit.plan` - To generate implementation plan and design artifacts (recommended next step)

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` as no clarifications are needed.
