## What We Discovered

### Critical Finding
**Phase 4 was marked complete but never actually implemented.** The IBKR client was never initialized or connected to the DataCatalogService.

### Bugs Found and Fixed
1. ‚úÖ IBKR client not initialized in DataCatalogService
2. ‚úÖ Missing `await` keyword for async method
3. ‚úÖ Missing `fetch_bars()` method implementation
4. ‚úÖ Environment variable parsing issues
5. ‚úÖ Wrong parameter names for Nautilus API
6. ‚úÖ Timezone handling problems
7. ‚úÖ Missing `instrument_ids` parameter
8. ‚úÖ Bar specification format ‚≠ê FIXED in Session 2
9. ‚è≥ Instrument not added to backtest cache (Bug #9 - BLOCKER)
10. ‚è≥ Availability cache not detecting files (Bug #10 - HIGH)

**Fixed**: 8 out of 10 bugs (80%)
**Session 1**: 7 bugs fixed (87.5%)
**Session 2**: 1 bug fixed, 2 new bugs discovered

---

## What Works Now

### ‚úÖ Successful Components
- IBKR client initialization from `.env`
- Connection to IBKR TWS/Gateway (tested on port 7497)
- Instrument lookup and contract resolution
- Rate limiting (45 req/sec with sliding window)
- Retry logic (exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s)
- Clear error messages with recovery steps
- Progress indicators and logging
- **Historical bar data fetching from IBKR** (60 bars in 2.31s) ‚≠ê NEW
- **Parquet file creation and persistence** (5.2KB files) ‚≠ê NEW
- **Correct Nautilus API format** (contracts + bar_specifications) ‚≠ê NEW

### Test Output (Success)
```
‚úÖ Connected to Interactive Brokers (v187)
‚úÖ Market data farm connection is OK
‚úÖ Contract qualified for AAPL.NASDAQ with ConId=265598
‚úÖ Retry logic executing with exponential backoff
‚úÖ Fetched 60 bars from IBKR in 2.31s ‚≠ê NEW
üíæ Data saved to catalog - future backtests will use cached data ‚≠ê NEW
```

---

## What Still Needs Work

### ‚ùå Bug #9: Instrument Not Added to Backtest Cache (CRITICAL)

**Error Message**:
```
‚ùå Backtest failed: `Instrument` AAPL.NASDAQ for the given data not found in the
cache. Add the instrument through `add_instrument()` prior to adding related data.
```

**Issue**: Instrument fetched from IBKR is not being registered with backtest engine before bar data is added.

**Location**: `src/core/backtest_runner.py`

**Impact**: Blocks backtest execution, prevents User Story 2 completion

---

### ‚ùå Bug #10: Availability Cache Not Detecting Parquet Files (HIGH)

**Symptom**:
```
2025-10-15 15:01:49 [info] availability_cache_rebuilt total_entries=0
‚ö†Ô∏è  No data in catalog for AAPL
   Will attempt to fetch from IBKR...
```

**Issue**: Parquet files exist but cache shows 0 entries, causing unnecessary IBKR fetches every run.

**Location**: `src/services/data_catalog.py`

**Impact**: Cache never used, blocks User Story 1 testing, wastes API calls

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
export IBKR_PORT=7497  # Temporary
# OR remove from ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc permanently
```

### Working Configuration
```bash
IBKR_HOST=127.0.0.1
IBKR_PORT=7497       # TWS paper trading
IBKR_CLIENT_ID=10
```

## Lessons Learned

### Session 1 Insights
1. **Always Test Before Marking Complete**
   - Code that compiles isn't code that works
   - External API integrations are complex
   - End-to-end testing is essential

2. **Environment Variables Are Tricky**
   - System env vars silently override .env files
   - Inline comments in .env need special handling
   - Always document configuration requirements

3. **API Documentation Is Critical**
   - Nautilus Trader has specific requirements
   - Parameter names and types must match exactly
   - Timezone handling varies between frameworks

4. **Incremental Development Works**
   - Fixed 7/8 bugs by testing each component
   - Clear error messages helped identify issues
   - Logging was invaluable for debugging

### Session 2 Insights ‚≠ê NEW
5. **Research Tools Are Invaluable**
   - Context7 MCP tool provided accurate Nautilus documentation in minutes
   - Finding official examples saves hours of trial-and-error
   - Documentation with code samples is worth its weight in gold

6. **Bug Cascades Are Real**
   - Fixing Bug #8 immediately revealed Bug #9 and #10
   - Each layer of integration has its own issues
   - Progress isn't always linear - bugs hide behind bugs

7. **Data Formats Matter Deeply**
   - API parameter formats ‚â† stored data formats
   - `bar_specifications` vs bar type strings are different concepts
   - Never assume format consistency across system boundaries

8. **Testing Reveals Integration Gaps**
   - Data fetch works ‚â† full system works
   - Integration points need explicit testing
   - Assumptions about "automatic" behavior are dangerous

---

## Performance Observations

### Connection Timing
- IBKR connection: ~2 seconds
- Instrument lookup: ~100ms
- Overall initialization: ~3 seconds

### Memory Usage
- Baseline + ~5MB for Nautilus client
- No memory leaks observed
- Availability cache: negligible overhead

### Rate Limiting
- Configured: 45 req/sec
- Actual: Not triggered (single request during test)
- Implementation: Sliding window algorithm ‚úÖ

---

## Recommendations

### Critical ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Do not deploy** until Bug #9 and #10 are resolved
2. **Do not mark Phase 4 complete** until end-to-end backtest passes
3. **Fix Bug #9 immediately** - blocks all backtest execution
4. **Add integration tests** before considering feature done

### High Priority üî¥
1. ~~Fix bar specification format (Bug #8)~~ ‚úÖ DONE
2. **Fix Bug #10** - cache not detecting files (performance issue)
3. Test User Story 1 after Bug #10 fixed
4. Test User Story 2 end-to-end after Bug #9 fixed
5. ~~Document Nautilus API quirks discovered~~ ‚úÖ DONE (BUG-8-FIX.md)
6. Add CI/CD checks for integration tests

### Medium Priority üü°
1. Refactor data_catalog.py to meet 500 line limit
2. Add more granular error messages
3. Improve logging configuration
4. Create troubleshooting documentation
5. Update tasks.md with accurate progress

## Conclusion

### Session Summary

**Two testing sessions revealed significant gaps between "marked complete" and "actually working."** Eight critical bugs were fixed across both sessions, with major progress in data fetching capability.

### Session 1 Achievements
- Fixed 7 bugs (IBKR client init, async/await, fetch_bars, env vars, parameters)
- Enabled IBKR connection and instrument lookup
- Identified Bug #8 as critical blocker

### Session 2 Achievements ‚≠ê NEW
- Fixed Bug #8 using Context7 MCP research tool (25 minutes)
- **Data fetching now fully functional** (60 bars in 2.31s)
- **Parquet files created successfully** (5.2KB)
- Discovered Bug #9 (instrument cache) and Bug #10 (availability cache)

### Current Status

**Progress**: 80% functional (8/10 bugs fixed)
- ‚úÖ **Data Fetch Layer**: 100% working
- ‚è≥ **Integration Layer**: 2 bugs remaining

**User Story Status**:
- US1 (Cached Data): Blocked by Bug #10
- US2 (Auto-fetch): 80% complete, blocked by Bug #9
- US3 (Error Messages): 100% passing

### Next Steps

**Immediate Priority**:
1. Fix Bug #9 (instrument cache) - ~30 minutes - CRITICAL
2. Fix Bug #10 (availability cache) - ~45 minutes - HIGH
3. Complete end-to-end testing

**Estimated Time to Completion**: ~2 hours

### Recommendation

**Do not mark Phase 4 complete** until Bug #9 and #10 are resolved and end-to-end backtest passes. The data fetching layer is solid - remaining work is integration with backtest engine.
