# Product Requirements Document: Algorithmic Trading Platform

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a Python-based backtesting and live trading application. The primary problem this application solves is the need for a flexible and robust platform for developing, testing, and deploying multi-timeframe trading strategies that can utilize various data sources, including signals from machine learning models. A key requirement is to ensure consistency, meaning the same strategy logic (class) used for backtesting is the identical one used for live trading. The application will leverage the Nautilus Trader framework and integrate with Interactive Brokers (IB) for both historical data and live trade execution.

The main goal is to enable a retail trader to perform systematic algorithmic trading efficiently and reliably.

## 2. Goals

*   Develop a Python application for backtesting and live trading using Nautilus Trader.
*   Enable the creation and deployment of trading strategies that operate on multiple timeframes (ranging from 1-minute to weekly bars).
*   Allow strategies to incorporate various data sources, including standard OHLCV market data, fundamental data, and signals from external sources like machine learning models.
*   Ensure the identical strategy implementation is used for both backtesting against historical data and for live trading execution.
*   Utilize Interactive Brokers (IB) as the primary data source for historical data (backtesting) and as the brokerage for live trading.
*   Provide a simple web-based dashboard for visualizing and evaluating the performance of strategies in both backtest and live trading scenarios.
*   Initially support trading of stocks, ETFs, and currencies, with a design that allows for future expansion to other asset classes like cryptocurrencies.
*   Achieve reliable and accurate trade simulation in backtesting and dependable order execution in live trading.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a trader, I want to backtest my strategy on historical IB data (OHLCV, fundamental) so that I can evaluate its past performance across various instruments and timeframes.
*   As a trader, I want to deploy my thoroughly backtested strategy to live trade on my Interactive Brokers account so that I can automate my trading decisions and execution.
*   As a trader, I want to visualize the performance of a strategy I have backtested (including key metrics like total return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown) through a web dashboard so that I can easily assess its viability.
*   As a trader, I want to view the real-time performance and key metrics of my live trading strategies via the web dashboard.
*   As a trader, I want to define and run strategies that incorporate data from multiple timeframes (e.g., using daily trend to inform 5-minute entry signals) and external signals (e.g., ML model predictions) to make more informed trading decisions.
*   As a trader, I want the system to store my strategy configurations and backtest results so I can review and compare them later.

17. FR17: The dashboard **must** display key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations (e.g., equity curves, drawdown charts) for backtested strategies.
18. FR18: The dashboard **must** display KPIs and relevant information for live trading strategies, including current positions and P&L.
19. FR19: Common KPIs to display include: Total Return, Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win/Loss Ratio, Average Win, Average Loss, Profit Factor.

### Data Management
20. FR20: The system **must** store strategy parameters, backtest results, live trade logs, and system configuration settings.
21. FR21: An SQLite database **must** be used for data persistence in the initial version.

### Error Handling & Reliability
22. FR22: The system **must** gracefully handle disconnections from the Interactive Brokers API and implement a reconnection strategy.
23. FR23: The system **must** implement mechanisms to detect and handle potential market data gaps or errors from IB.
24. FR24: The system **must** adequately manage order execution anomalies such as rejections, partial fills, or errors from IB, with appropriate logging and user notification (if applicable).

### Supported Asset Classes
25. FR25: The initial version of the system **must** support trading of stocks, ETFs, and major currency pairs (Forex).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

*   Trading of options or other derivatives (beyond stocks, ETFs, Forex).
*   Utilization of tick-level data for strategy execution or backtesting.
*   Advanced, highly customizable UI/UX features. The focus is on a functional and maintainable interface.
*   Direct integration with cryptocurrency exchanges (this is a potential future enhancement).
*   Automated strategy optimization features.
*   Paper trading functionality beyond what IB Gateway/TWS offers (the system will interact with a live or paper IB account).

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

*   **User Interface:**
    *   A simple, clean, and intuitive web-based interface is preferred.
    *   The UI should be easy to maintain and expand upon in future iterations.
    *   Consider using a lightweight Python web framework such as Flask or Dash (Dash is particularly well-suited for data-heavy dashboards).
    *   The primary purpose of the UI is to display performance metrics, allow basic strategy management (start/stop), and view logs.
*   **Modularity:** Design the system with modularity in mind to facilitate future enhancements, such as adding new data sources, brokers, or analytical tools.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

*   **Core Framework:** Nautilus Trader will be the central framework.
*   **Broker Integration:** Relies on Nautilus Trader's existing or future support for Interactive Brokers.
*   **Database:** SQLite is sufficient for the initial version for storing strategy configurations, backtest results, and trade logs.
*   **Web Stack:** If using Flask, consider Jinja2 for templating. If using Dash, leverage its built-in components for interactivity.
*   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging throughout the application for debugging, auditing, and monitoring purposes.
*   **Configuration Management:** Use a clear method for managing application and strategy configurations (e.g., YAML or JSON files, or database storage).

## 8. Success Metrics

*   **Backtesting Accuracy:** Backtest results for benchmark strategies are comparable to results from other trusted platforms or manual calculations (within an acceptable margin of error).
*   **Strategy Versatility:** The system can successfully run at least two distinct strategies that utilize multi-timeframe analysis and one strategy that incorporates an external data signal (e.g., mock ML output).
*   **Live Trading Reliability:** Successful execution of trades (entry and exit) via Interactive Brokers in a live paper trading environment for at least one strategy over a continuous 1-week period without critical failures.
*   **Data Integrity:** Real-time position tracking and P&L reporting in the application dashboard accurately match the statements and data provided by Interactive Brokers.
*   **User (Self) Enablement:** The primary user can successfully:
    *   Define and configure a new trading strategy.
    *   Run a backtest for the strategy using historical IB data.
    *   Analyze the backtest results via the web dashboard.
    *   Deploy the strategy for live (paper) trading.
    *   Monitor the live strategy's performance and P&L through the dashboard.
*   **Dashboard Utility:** The performance dashboard clearly and accurately displays all specified key metrics for both backtests and live trading sessions.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What is the specific format and integration method for signals from machine learning models? (Can be deferred, but good to keep in mind for future interface design).
*   Are there any other specific key performance metrics, beyond the common ones listed (Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, etc.), that absolutely must be on the dashboard in the first version?
*   While "simple" is the goal for the UI, are there any minimal preferences for visual style or layout (e.g., "clean and minimalist," "dark mode preferred," preference for chart types)?
*   What level of detail is required for trade logs accessible to the user (e.g., entry/exit times, prices, quantities, reasons for trade, slippage, commission)?
*   What are the specific commission and slippage models to be implemented in the backtester for realistic simulations?
