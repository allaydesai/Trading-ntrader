"""Integration test fixtures and configuration.

This module provides fixtures for integration tests that use real Nautilus
framework components, including C extensions that require special cleanup.

IMPORTANT: Integration tests MUST run with subprocess isolation (--forked flag)
to prevent C extension crashes from cascading between tests.

Why --forked is Required:
--------------------------
Nautilus Trader uses C/Cython extensions that maintain internal state. When a
test crashes or leaves the C extension in a bad state, subsequent tests in the
same process can experience cascade failures or segfaults.

The pytest-forked plugin runs each integration test in a separate subprocess,
ensuring complete isolation. If a test crashes, only that subprocess fails -
other tests continue normally in fresh processes.

Running Integration Tests:
--------------------------
Always use the Makefile target which includes --forked:
    make test-integration

Or run directly with pytest:
    pytest tests/integration/ -n auto --forked

NEVER run integration tests without --forked in CI/CD or shared environments.

    This fixture runs automatically after every integration test to clean up

    Cleanup Strategy:
    - Double gc.collect() to handle cyclic references in C extensions
    - Explicit cleanup for Nautilus engine instances (handled in tests via dispose())
    - Runs after each test via autouse=True

    Note: Even with this cleanup, --forked isolation is still required to
    prevent cascade failures from C extension crashes.
