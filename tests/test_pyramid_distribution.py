"""Test pyramid distribution validation.

This module validates that the test suite maintains proper test pyramid distribution
as defined in design.md Section 1.1 - Test Pyramid Structure.

Target Distribution:
- Unit tests: 50% or more of total test suite
- Component tests: 20-30% of total test suite
- Integration tests: 15-25% of total test suite
- E2E tests: 5% or less of total test suite

Purpose: Ensure test suite maintains fast feedback loops through proper distribution
